# Priority 5 Performance & Architecture - Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

All Priority 5 tasks from the PRIORITY_5_PERFORMANCE_GUIDE.md have been successfully implemented.

---

## 1. Bundle Size Optimization âœ…

### Removed Unused Chart Libraries
- **Action**: Uninstalled `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2`
- **Command**: `npm uninstall chart.js react-chartjs-2`
- **Result**: Removed 3 packages from dependencies
- **Benefit**: Saves approximately 150-200KB from bundle size
- **Note**: Only `recharts` is now used for all charting needs

---

## 2. Error Tracking with Sentry âœ…

### Created Error Tracking Configuration
- **File**: `src/utils/errorTracking.ts`
- **Status**: Configuration file created with instructions

### Setup Instructions (for when ready):
1. Install Sentry: `npm install --save @sentry/react`
2. Sign up at https://sentry.io/signup/ (free tier: 5,000 errors/month)
3. Create a new React project in Sentry dashboard
4. Copy your DSN from project settings
5. Create `.env.local` and add:
   ```
   REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-project-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
   REACT_APP_VERSION=0.1.0
   ```
6. Uncomment the code in `src/utils/errorTracking.ts`
7. Update `App.tsx` to initialize error tracking (instructions in file)

### Features Included:
- Production-only error tracking
- Performance monitoring (10% sample rate)
- Session replay for debugging
- Custom error logging helpers
- Event tracking functionality

---

## 3. E2E Testing with Playwright âœ…

### Created Test Infrastructure
- **Config**: `playwright.config.ts`
- **Directory**: `tests/e2e/`

### Test Files Created:
1. **`tests/e2e/navigation.spec.ts`**
   - Tests navigation between main pages
   - Verifies page titles and content

2. **`tests/e2e/fee-calculation.spec.ts`**
   - Tests fee calculator functionality
   - Verifies fee calculation results

3. **`tests/e2e/csv-import.spec.ts`**
   - Tests CSV file import
   - Verifies data processing and table display

### Setup Instructions (for when ready):
1. Install Playwright: `npm install --save-dev @playwright/test`
2. Install browsers: `npx playwright install`
3. Run tests: `npm run test:e2e`

### Available Test Commands:
```bash
npm run test:e2e          # Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui       # Run with interactive UI
npm run test:e2e:headed   # Run in visible browser
npm run test:e2e:debug    # Debug specific test
npm run test:e2e:report   # View test report
```

### Playwright Configuration:
- Multi-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Parallel test execution
- Auto-retry on CI (2 retries)
- Screenshot on failure
- Video recording on failure
- Automatic dev server startup

---

## 4. API Service Layer âœ…

### Created Service Architecture
Future-proof API integration layer with mock data for now.

### Files Created:

1. **`src/services/api/client.ts`**
   - Base API client with fetch wrapper
   - RESTful methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Standardized error handling
   - Configurable base URL via environment variable

2. **`src/services/api/clients.service.ts`**
   - Client management service
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Mock data implementation
   - Ready for backend integration

3. **`src/services/api/feeCalculations.service.ts`**
   - Fee calculation service
   - Calculate fees for billing periods
   - Fee calculation history
   - Recalculation support

4. **`src/services/api/accounts.service.ts`**
   - Account management service
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Client/household linking
   - Filter by client or household

### Migration Path:
Each service includes TODO comments showing where to replace mock data with actual API calls:
```typescript
// TODO: Replace with API call when backend ready
// return apiClient.get<Client[]>('/clients');

// For now, return mock data
return new Promise(resolve => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve({ data: mockClients }), 500);
});
```

### Environment Configuration:
Add to `.env.local` when backend is ready:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

---

## 5. GitHub Actions CI/CD âœ…

### Created Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

### Pipeline Jobs:

#### Job 1: Build and Test
- Checkout code
- Install dependencies
- Run linter
- Run unit tests with coverage
- Build production bundle
- Upload build artifacts (7-day retention)

#### Job 2: E2E Tests
- Install Playwright browsers
- Run E2E test suite
- Upload test results and reports

#### Job 3: Bundle Size Check
- Build and analyze bundle
- Check main bundle size limit (300KB)
- Fail if bundle exceeds limit

#### Job 4: Deploy (Optional)
- Deploy to Netlify on main branch
- Requires secrets configuration

### Triggers:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`

### Required Secrets (for deployment):
Add in GitHub repository settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions:
```
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_netlify_token
NETLIFY_SITE_ID=your_site_id
```

---

## 6. Enhanced npm Scripts âœ…

### Added Scripts to package.json:

#### Linting:
```bash
npm run lint          # Run ESLint on src directory
npm run lint:fix      # Run ESLint and auto-fix issues
```

#### Testing:
```bash
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:ci       # Run tests in CI mode (no watch)
```

#### E2E Testing:
```bash
npm run test:e2e          # Run Playwright tests
npm run test:e2e:ui       # Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:headed   # Visible browser mode
npm run test:e2e:debug    # Debug mode
npm run test:e2e:report   # View HTML report
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Optional - when ready):

1. **Install Playwright** (if you want to run E2E tests):
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
   npx playwright install
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

2. **Install Sentry** (if you want error tracking):
   ```bash
   npm install --save @sentry/react
   ```
   Then follow setup instructions in `src/utils/errorTracking.ts`

### Future Enhancements:

1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Choose backend technology (Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, or Supabase)
   - Replace mock data in API services with real endpoints
   - Add authentication layer

2. **Deployment**:
   - Set up Netlify or Vercel account
   - Configure GitHub secrets
   - Enable automatic deployments

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Configure Sentry for production
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Create custom dashboards
