  - No foreign keys or referential integrity
  - Difficult aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT with JOINs)
  - Complex queries are hard/impossible
  - Data denormalization required (duplicates data everywhere)
- **Query Limitations** - Can't do complex SQL-like queries
- **Cost Model** - Charges per read/write operation
  - Can get expensive FAST for data-heavy apps
  - Hard to predict costs
- **Vendor Lock-in** - Very Firebase-specific code
- **Document Size Limits** - 1MB per document
- **Not Ideal for Reporting** - Financial reports need SQL

### Pricing 💰
```
Spark (Free):
├── 1GB Storage
├── 50,000 reads/day
├── 20,000 writes/day
├── 10GB bandwidth/month

Blaze (Pay-as-you-go):
├── $0.18 per 100K reads
├── $0.18 per 100K writes
├── $0.02/GB storage/month

For 100 users checking balances frequently:
└── Could be $50-200/month easily
```

### Example Problem
```javascript
// Want to calculate: Total AUM by client with accounts > $1M

// In SQL (easy):
SELECT
  clients.name,
  SUM(accounts.balance) as total_aum
FROM clients
JOIN accounts ON clients.id = accounts.client_id
GROUP BY clients.id
HAVING total_aum > 1000000;

// In Firestore (painful):
// 1. Get all clients
// 2. For each client, get all accounts
// 3. Calculate sum in JavaScript
// 4. Filter in JavaScript
// Result: 100+ database queries, slow, expensive
```

### When to Choose
- ✅ Building a mobile app (iOS/Android)

### Scenario 1: "I want to launch ASAP and iterate fast"
**Supabase** 🏆
- 4-6 hours to production
- PostgreSQL for financial data
- No backend code needed
- Real-time updates built-in
- **Start here, migrate later if needed**

### Scenario 2: "I want to learn backend development"
**Railway + Express.js**
- Build your own API
- Learn backend patterns
- Full control
- Still reasonable cost ($5-20/month)

### Scenario 3: "I need to stay under $10/month forever"
**Supabase Free Tier** or **Railway Free**
- Both have generous free tiers
- Supabase: 500MB, good for 6-12 months
- Railway: $5 credit/month

### Scenario 4: "I'm building an enterprise product"
**Supabase Pro** or **AWS/Google Cloud**
- Start with Supabase Pro ($25/month)
- Migrate to cloud if you need specific enterprise features
- Don't over-engineer early

### Scenario 5: "I have a backend developer on team"
**Railway** or **Render** + **Custom Node.js API**
- Full control
- Custom business logic
- Still managed database
- Learn modern backend development

## 🚀 Final Recommendation

### For Your Financial Manager App:

**Start with: Supabase** 🏆

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ **Speed**: Launch in 4-6 hours
2. ✅ **PostgreSQL**: Perfect for financial data
3. ✅ **Cost**: Free for months, $25/month when you scale
4. ✅ **Features**: Everything you need (auth, storage, real-time)
5. ✅ **Migration Path**: Can move to custom backend anytime

**Migration Path if Needed:**
```
Phase 1: Supabase (months 1-12)
└── Launch, validate, grow

Phase 2: Supabase + Custom API (if needed)
└── Add custom endpoints for complex logic
└── Keep Supabase for simple CRUD

Phase 3: Full Custom Backend (if needed)
└── Migrate to Railway/Cloud SQL
└── Export PostgreSQL data (standard format)
└── Build complete custom API
```

You can **always migrate later**. Supabase uses standard PostgreSQL, so your data is portable.

## ❓ Questions to Ask Yourself

**Choose Supabase if you answer YES to:**

- [ ] I don't have a backend developer
- [ ] Financial data needs SQL (yes!)
- [ ] Real-time updates would be nice
- [ ] I want TypeScript everywhere
- [ ] Cost matters
- [ ] I can always migrate later

**Choose Custom Backend if you answer YES to:**
- [ ] I have backend developer(s)
- [ ] Complex custom business logic needed now
- [ ] I have 2-4 weeks to build
- [ ] I need very specific backend control
- [ ] Budget isn't a concern
- [ ] I want to learn backend development

---

## 🎓 What Would I Do?

If this were my project, I'd:

1. **Start with Supabase** (4-6 hours setup)
2. **Launch and get feedback** (weeks 1-4)
3. **Iterate based on real user needs** (months 1-6)
4. **Evaluate if custom backend needed** (month 6+)
5. **Migrate only if necessary** (month 12+)

**Don't over-engineer early!** Get to market, validate the product, then scale.
